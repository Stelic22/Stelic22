- 👋 Hi, I’m @Stelic22
- 👀 I’m interested in learning machine learning, python and data science to solve database management issues at my job in the public sector.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning though the Odin community to ground out my basics after spending a few years of just learning very specific solutions to particular problems, 
      usually involving pandas or basic python data management queries
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly learning examples with a goal of getting more proficiency in tools like numpy and finding solutions outside of my usual data science numpy/pandas thinking
- 📫 Reach me on here, thought I'm not sure what I can do to help yet.
